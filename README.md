Check out the function over there on line 1. It takes in two 
parameters (**num1** and **num2**) as input. And as output it will 
**"return"** the result of adding them together. The keyword **return** is 
how you make it so that the function evaluates to a certain value, 
in this case the total of **num1** plus **num2**.

Then on line 6 inside of a console.log (which is a fancy thing that allows you to print 
things to the console down below) the function is "called" 
(meaning used) with a 4 that will go into the function as num1 and 
a 6 which will go into the function as num2.

When the function runs it adds 4 and 6 and evaluates to 10. Hit run and see, then 
try calling it again with different values. Play around with it. 
Reread again about how it works if you need to. But don't 
overthink it.

Your task: Write your own function called subtractNums that takes two parameters and returns the first one minus the second one. Use console.log() to call your function to make sure you have the right result. Once again, don't just overwrite the addNums function. Write your own function.
